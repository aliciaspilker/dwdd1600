            <h2>Asha Puthli</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Puthli is an Indian jazz and disco singer</li>
                <li>In 2009, her music was trantransmitted into space to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the moon landing which led to Puthli indentifying as a “space cadet.”</li>
                <li>She's always been a strong influence in Raveena's life and this is noticeable in the album Asha's Awakening where Puthli is featured on the song "Asha's Kiss."</li>
                <li>Both Raveena and Puthli share the outlook of outer space being a "realm of escape and fantasy."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>M.I.A.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>M.I.A. is a British-Sri Lankan rapper, record producer, and singer.</li>
                <li>She inspired Raveena in her teenage years after Raveena watched a person that she felt represented a version of herself get into mainstream music.</li>
                <li>Raveena especially admires how she has control over every part of her career.</li>
            </ul>
