        <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Raveena Aurora is an <strong>Indian Punjabi American</strong> artist born on September 30, 1993 in Massachusetts. Her parents are immigrants from Punjab, India. They moved to the United States of America after the 1984 anti-Sikh riots which caused a lot of turmoil in their lives. Her parents raised her in a household with strong Sikh traditions and values. When she was younger, she spent some of her time writing poetry and listening to music. Around middle school age, she discovered a few different genres including R&#38;B and Soul which later became a big <a href="inspirations.html#sign">inspiration</a> for her current artistic style.</p>
            <p>Raveena said that she discovered her desire to pursue a music career ever since she was very young. She started singing at 11 years old, and wrote her first song at 12 years old. Despite being hesitant at first, her parents supported her in growing her artistic skills and she eventually graduated from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. At the beginning of her career, she faced discrimination because of her ethnicity and would work a variety of full-time jobs in order to support her music projects. She met and began working with a record producer named Everett Orr in 2015. They worked together to release 3 singles in 2016 before she released her first EP, Shanti,  in 2017 after gaining a substantial following online. She’s continued creating a variety of music since then including the albums Lucid and Asha’s Awakening.</p>
